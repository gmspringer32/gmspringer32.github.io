# Cleaning DataFrames in Python: A Comprehensive Guide

Data cleaning is an essential step in any data analysis project. Messy, inconsistent, or incomplete data can lead to inaccurate results and unreliable insights. In Python, one of the most common data structures for data manipulation is the Pandas DataFrame. In this guide, we will explore various techniques and best practices for cleaning DataFrames in Python.

## 1. Importing Pandas

Before you start cleaning data, you'll need to import the Pandas library. It provides powerful tools for data manipulation, including DataFrames, which are like tables in a database but in Python. By convention, you import it as pd.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

## 2. Loading Data

Pandas offers ways to read multiple different types of files like csv, html, json, excel, and many others. To keep it simple we will use a csv file provided here https://github.com/esnt/Data/raw/main/Flights/flights.csv

```python
df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/esnt/Data/raw/main/Flights/flights.csv')
print(df)
```

## 3. Handling Missing Data
Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets. You can identify and handle missing values using methods like isnull(), fillna(), or dropna().
