# Can you predict how far a team will go in the postseason based on their regular season?

We can see that on average a team with a higher winning percentage during the season will go farther in the tournament and the spread also decreases as the tournament goes on. The round of 68 is a little weird because those are play in games so teams with a higher winning percentage will not get represented. Lets see now the lowest seed in each round and the highest seed that got knocked out each round

```python
display(df[['SEED', 'POSTSEASON']].groupby('POSTSEASON').max().reindex(['R64', 'R32', 'S16', 'E8', 'F4', '2ND','Champions']))
display(df[['SEED', 'POSTSEASON']].groupby(['POSTSEASON']).min().reindex(['R64', 'R32', 'S16', 'E8', 'F4', '2ND','Champions']))

Interesting. So in the last 10 or so years in every round there has been at least 1 team seeded first that has been eliminated.

```python
df_wo_NTteams = df.loc[(df['POSTSEASON'] != 'NT') & (df['POSTSEASON'] != 'R68')]
avg_seed = df_wo_NTteams[['SEED', 'POSTSEASON']].groupby('POSTSEASON').mean().reindex(['R64', 'R32', 'S16', 'E8', 'F4', '2ND','Champions'])

fig, [ax, ax2] = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 8))
sns.barplot(x = avg_seed.index, y = avg_seed['SEED'], ax = ax)
ax.set_xlabel('Round team got knocked out')
ax.set_ylabel('Average seed of team')
ax.set_title('Avereage seed of teams and when they got eliminated from the tournament')

sns.boxplot(y = df_wo_NTteams['SEED'], x = df_wo_NTteams['POSTSEASON'], ax = ax2, order = ['R64', 'R32', 'S16','E8', 'F4', '2ND', 'Champions'])
ax2.set_xlabel('Round team got knocked out')
ax2.set_ylabel('Seed of team')
ax2.set_title('Avereage seed of teams and when they got eliminated from the tournament')
plt.show()
```

From these graphs vs the one above for win percentage, win percentage looks like a better estimator for how far they make it in the tournament. It is also interesting that in the final 4 there is a bigger spread than the elite 8

# Which conference produces the most champions?

```python
d = pd.DataFrame(df[['CONF', 'POSTSEASON']].loc[(df['POSTSEASON'] == 'Champions') | (df['POSTSEASON'] == '2ND') | (df['POSTSEASON'] == 'F4') | (df['POSTSEASON'] == 'E8')].value_counts()).reset_index()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,7))

#### The only conference that has had teams that have been knocked out in each of the rounds at and after elite 8 is the ACC. The champions have come from only the ACC, BE, and Amer conferences, with Amer only being represented once

# Upsets

#### One of the biggest questions in the tournament is when and who will be involved in an upset. In the first round of 64, there are 32 games which means there is a possible 32 upsets. The greater the spread in seed, the more shocking it is when there is an upset.

We will look at seeds 1-8 who lost in the 1st round (upset)

```python
temp_df = df[df.SEED != 'None']
temp_df['SEED'] = temp_df['SEED'].astype('int')
temp_df = temp_df.loc[(temp_df['POSTSEASON'] == 'R64') & (temp_df['SEED'] <= 8)]
seed_upset_df = pd.DataFrame(temp_df['SEED'].value_counts()).reset_index().rename(columns = {'index' : 'SEED', 'SEED': 'Count'}).sort_values(by = 'SEED', ascending = True)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (8, 5))
sns.barplot(x = seed_upset_df['SEED'], y = seed_upset_df['Count'], ax = ax)
ax.set_title('Seed and how many times they have been upset in the first round of the tournament')
plt.show()
```

# Lets model a tournament and see how it does

### 2016 had a lot of upsets

![BCG-winner-bracket-2016.jpg](Screenshot1.png)

#### The March Madness tournament is basically 4 single elimination tournaments put into one, with the winners of each going into another single elimination tournament (semis). So we will model one single elimination tournament and use it for all 4 for the 2016 tournament

```python
df = pd.read_csv('ncaab2.csv')
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns = ["CONF"])
df['SEED'] = df['SEED'].fillna('None')
df['POSTSEASON'] = df['POSTSEASON'].fillna('NT')
df['WP'] = df['W']/df['G']
index_NT = df[df['POSTSEASON'] == 'NT'].index
df.drop(index_NT, inplace = True)
df["SEED"].replace({'None':19}, inplace = True)
df['POSTSEASON'].replace({'Champions' : 1, '2ND':2, 'F4':3, 'E8':4, 'S16':5, 'R32':6, 'R64':7, 'R68':8, 'NT':9}, inplace = True)
```

```python
dftest = pd.read_csv('ncaab.csv')
dftest = pd.get_dummies(dftest, columns = ["CONF"])
dftest['SEED'] = dftest['SEED'].fillna('None')
dftest['POSTSEASON'] = dftest['POSTSEASON'].fillna('NT')
dftest['WP'] = dftest['W']/df['G']
index_NT = dftest[dftest['POSTSEASON'] == 'NT'].index
dftest.drop(index_NT, inplace = True)
dftest["SEED"].replace({'None':19}, inplace = True)
dftest['POSTSEASON'].replace({'Champions' : 1, '2ND':2, 'F4':3, 'E8':4, 'S16':5, 'R32':6, 'R64':7, 'R68':8, 'NT':9}, inplace = True)


X = dftest.drop(["POSTSEASON", "YEAR", "TEAM",], axis = 1)
y = dftest["POSTSEASON"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
```

I will test a couple of models here to see which one does the best

```python
models = [RandomForestClassifier(), RandomForestRegressor(), LinearRegression()]
for i in range(len(models)):
    model_i = models[i]
    model_i.fit(X_train, y_train)
    Y_pred_i = model_i.predict(X_test)
    print("Y_pred_", i, "score = ", model_i.score(X_test, y_test))
    print(1 - (1-model_i.score(X, y))*(len(y)-1)/(len(y)-X.shape[1]-1))
```

    Y_pred_ 0 score =  0.5296610169491526
    0.8747092762010893
    Y_pred_ 1 score =  0.6616542177139173
    0.8814344967983481
    Y_pred_ 2 score =  0.5483815965024391
    0.5917293933833976

RandomForestRegressor performed the best. Even though technically the round the team was knocked out in is discrete we will look at is as continuous so it produces better estimates

```python
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("score = ", model.score(X_test, y_test))
```

    score =  0.6625456879709741

```python
importances = model.feature_importances_
features = pd.DataFrame({'feature': X_train.columns, 'importance': importances})

# Sort the DataFrame based on the feature importances
features = features.sort_values(by='importance', ascending=False)

features.to_csv('feature_importance_revenue.csv')

# Print the top 10 features and their importances
print("Top 10 features:")
for i, row in features[:10].iterrows():
    print("- Feature", row['feature'], ":", row['importance'])
```

    Top 10 features:
    - Feature G : 0.6172673848752628
